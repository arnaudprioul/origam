# Nuxt integration

origam ships an official Nuxt 3 / Nuxt 4 module that wires the design
system into a Nuxt application in one line: auto-imports for every
`Origam*` component and `useXxx` composable, SSR-safe resolution of both
theming axes — the brand `theme` (via cookie) and the color `mode` (via
cookie + `Sec-CH-Prefers-Color-Scheme`) — and automatic injection of the
token stylesheets in the right order.

The module is published as a **sub-export of `origam`** — there is no
separate package to install. You get the components, the tokens, the
composables and the Nuxt module in a single dependency.

## Installation

```bash
npm install origam
```

## Setup

Register the module in `nuxt.config.ts`:

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
    modules: ['origam/nuxt']
})
```

That is it. Every `Origam*` component and `useXxx` composable is now
auto-imported, the theme-invariant base sheets (primitive + utilities) are
loaded, the default brand theme is **installed as a runtime object**, and
both the active brand and color mode are resolved server-side so the first
paint already matches the user preference (no FOUC).

## Themes are installed as objects (ADR-003)

The module does **not** load a pre-generated CSS file per theme. Instead it
**installs theme objects** the way an external consumer would: it resolves
the `themes` option to `IOrigamTheme[]` and hands them to `createOrigam` in
the plugins, which inject each brand as a `[data-theme="…"][data-mode="…"]`
scoped `--origam-*` block. Only the theme-invariant `primitive` +
`utilities` sheets are loaded as CSS.

**No-flash SSR**: the server plugin also emits every configured theme's
scoped block as a real `<style data-origam-theme-ssr>` in the rendered HTML
(via `useHead`), so the first paint is already themed — no flash of
unstyled content, and the page stays themed even if client hydration is
delayed. The client plugin then re-injects the same blocks (id-keyed per
`name×mode`, replacing in place) for runtime theme switching.

`themes` entries may be:

- a **built-in preset name** (`'sobre'`, `'geek'`, …) — resolved to objects
  from `origam/themes`,
- an **`IOrigamTheme` object** or an **array** of them (e.g. a Theme Builder
  export, or the per-brand `sobreTheme` preset that bundles both modes).

```ts
import { geekTheme } from 'origam/themes'
import { myBrand } from './my-brand-theme' // a Builder export

export default defineNuxtConfig({
    modules: ['origam/nuxt'],
    origam: {
        themes: ['sobre', geekTheme, myBrand],
        defaultTheme: 'sobre',
        defaultMode: 'auto'
    }
})
```

## Configuration

All options are optional. Place them under the top-level `origam` key:

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
    modules: ['origam/nuxt'],
    origam: {
        themes: ['sobre', 'glass', 'geek'],
        defaultTheme: 'sobre',
        modes: ['light', 'dark'],
        defaultMode: 'auto',
        cookieName: 'origam-theme',
        modeCookieName: 'origam-mode',
        cookieMaxAge: 60 * 60 * 24 * 365,
        autoImport: true,
        includeUtilities: true,
        prefix: 'Origam'
    }
})
```

### Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `themes` | `(string \| IOrigamTheme \| IOrigamTheme[])[]` | `['origam']` | Themes to install. Preset names resolve to objects from `origam/themes`; objects/arrays are injected as-is. No per-theme CSS file is loaded. |
| `defaultTheme` | `string` | `'auto'` | Active brand when no cookie is set. `'auto'` renders no `data-theme` (the default brand). |
| `modes` | `string[]` | `['light', 'dark']` | Color modes supported by the loaded token sheets. Used to validate the resolved mode. |
| `defaultMode` | `string` | `'auto'` | Active color mode when no cookie is set. `'auto'` falls back to the `Sec-CH-Prefers-Color-Scheme` client hint, then to a concrete `'light'` SSR default (the client upgrades to the system preference). `data-mode` is always written concrete. |
| `cookieName` | `string` | `'origam-theme'` | Cookie that stores the user's chosen brand. |
| `modeCookieName` | `string` | `'origam-mode'` | Cookie that stores the user's chosen color mode. |
| `cookieMaxAge` | `number` | `31_536_000` (1 year) | Cookie lifetime in seconds (shared by both cookies). |
| `autoImport` | `boolean` | `true` | Auto-register components and composables as Nuxt auto-imports. |
| `includeUtilities` | `boolean` | `true` | Inject the utility-classes stylesheet (`origam-utilities.css`). |
| `prefix` | `string` | `'Origam'` | Reserved for future use. origam components already ship prefixed, so the active prefix is empty. |

## SSR theme + mode resolution

The server plugin reads the `origam-theme` and `origam-mode` cookies
before the response is rendered and injects the resolved values as
`<html data-theme="…" data-mode="…">` via Nuxt's `useHead()`.

- **Brand (`data-theme`)** is driven by the `origam-theme` cookie, then
  `defaultTheme`. It is omitted when the brand resolves to `'auto'` (the
  DS default sheet's `:root` rules then apply).
- **Mode (`data-mode`)** is driven by the `origam-mode` cookie, then
  `defaultMode`, then the `Sec-CH-Prefers-Color-Scheme` request header
  (sent by modern browsers when the `Accept-CH` response advertises
  support). It is **always written as a concrete `'light'` / `'dark'`** —
  never omitted: the token sheets are scoped to concrete `[data-mode]`
  values and have no mode-less fallback. When the user expressed no
  preference, the server writes the safe default `'light'`; the client
  upgrades it to the real `prefers-color-scheme` at mount.

The client plugin then picks up the attributes already set by the server,
so the hydration boundary stays clean — no flash of unstyled /
wrong-themed content, no hydration mismatch warning.

To opt-in to client-hint advertising, return `Accept-CH:
Sec-CH-Prefers-Color-Scheme` from your root response (Nitro middleware
or `routeRules`).

## Changing the theme at runtime

Use `useTheme()` — it is auto-imported by the module:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
    const {theme, resolved, setTheme, toggle} = useTheme()
</script>

<template>
    <button @click="toggle">
        {{ resolved === 'dark' ? 'Light mode' : 'Dark mode' }}
    </button>
</template>
```

The client plugin watches the composable's `theme` ref and persists
every change to the configured cookie. No extra wiring needed.

## Deriving a switcher from the installed themes

`useInstalledThemes()` returns the brands that were actually installed,
so a theme switcher stays in sync with the `themes` option instead of a
hard-coded list. Each entry carries `name`, `modes`, and the UI metadata
the installed theme objects provided (`label` — falls back to `name` —
plus optional `description` and `swatch`):

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
    const installed = useInstalledThemes()
    // → [{ name: 'sobre', modes: ['light','dark'], label: 'Sobre',
    //      description: 'Linear-style', swatch: 'linear-gradient(…)' }, …]
    const { theme, setTheme } = useTheme()
</script>

<template>
    <button
        v-for="brand in installed"
        :key="brand.name"
        :aria-pressed="theme === brand.name"
        @click="setTheme(brand.name)"
    >
        <span class="swatch" :style="{ background: brand.swatch }" />
        {{ brand.label }}
    </button>
</template>
```

The metadata comes from the `label` / `description` / `swatch` fields on
the installed `IOrigamTheme` objects. The brand-name list is also exposed
on `useRuntimeConfig().public.origam.themes` (names only) for SSR contexts.

## Opting out of auto-imports

If you need to namespace origam imports manually (conflict with another
design system, custom build pipeline, …) set `autoImport: false`:

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
    modules: ['origam/nuxt'],
    origam: {autoImport: false}
})
```

You can then import explicitly:

```ts
import {OrigamBtn, OrigamCard} from 'origam/components'
import {useTheme} from 'origam/composables'
```

The plugins, CSS injection and SSR theme resolution still apply — only
the magic `auto-import everything` step is disabled.

## Migrating from a manual `createOrigam()` setup

If your app already calls `app.use(createOrigam(...))` in a custom
plugin, remove that plugin and add `'origam/nuxt'` to `modules` instead.
The module installs origam with sensible defaults; you only need to
keep your manual plugin if you pass non-trivial `createOrigam()` options
(custom icon set, locale, blueprint, …). In that case, set
`autoImport: false` to avoid double registration and keep your manual
plugin for the `createOrigam()` call.

## Requirements

- Nuxt **3.x or 4.x**
- Node **>= 22** (origam's own engine requirement)
