# origam — Changelog

This changelog tracks releases of the `origam` package itself. Token-value
churn (Tokens Studio sync from Figma, semantic primitive shifts) lives in
[`tokens/CHANGELOG.md`](./tokens/CHANGELOG.md) — keep them separate so
"the design moved" never blocks a release of "the code shipped a new
component".

Format inspired by [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com).
This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).

## [Unreleased]

---

## [2.9.0] — 2026-07-22

Theming-enablement release. This ships the design-token **hooks** and the
`useDefaults` **wiring** that let a consumer configure a component's
appearance entirely from an `IOrigamTheme` object (props-first), plus the
CSS hooks brand themes need for translucency and separation. No breaking
changes — every addition is opt-in via a new component token with an inert
(`none`) fallback, so existing renders are byte-identical until a theme
sets a value.

### Added

- **`useDefaults()` now resolves per-component theme defaults on 11 more
  components** that declared theme-configurable props but never read
  `theme.components['origam-<name>']` — their theme config was silently
  inert before this. This is the mechanism that makes props-first theming
  actually apply. (#242)
- **Translucency & focus hooks on 7 components.** New component tokens,
  each consumed with an inert fallback (`var(--…, none)`):
  `--origam-chip---backdrop-filter`, `--origam-snackbar-item---backdrop-filter`,
  `--origam-field---backdrop-filter` (+ `--origam-field---focus-ring-*`),
  `--origam-switch__track---backdrop-filter`,
  `--origam-selection-control__input---backdrop-filter`,
  `--origam-tooltip---backdrop-filter`, `--origam-overlay-scrim---backdrop-filter`.
  These give brand themes real `backdrop-filter` translucency (glass, frosted
  surfaces) without per-instance `:style` overrides. (#253)
- **`OrigamAvatarGroup` separation ring.** Overlapping avatars now get a
  legible seam via a dedicated `outline` — a CSS property distinct from
  `box-shadow`, so it coexists with each theme's own avatar shadow with no
  specificity or ordering tricks. Driven by new
  `--origam-avatar-group__item---outline-{color,width,style}` tokens
  (defaults `color.surface.default` / `2px` / `solid`). Only avatars rendered
  inside an `<origam-avatar-group>` get it; a standalone `<origam-avatar>`
  never does. (#263)
- **`usePassedProps()` composable helper.** Reports which props a consumer
  actually passed by reading `vnode.props`, distinguishing a real value from
  Vue 3 coercing an unpassed boolean prop to `false`. Used so a
  theme-provided value is no longer overwritten by an `undefined → false`
  default. (#263)

### Fixed

- **Live theme switching now updates component default *props*, not just CSS
  variables.** The Nuxt module's theme singleton could be duplicated when the
  host app resolved `origam/nuxt` (source) and `origam/composables` (compiled
  `dist`) to two physical module files — two independent `_theme` singletons,
  so the plugin's watcher (which reassigns the resolved per-component
  defaults) listened to a different instance than the one `setTheme()`
  mutated. Props stayed frozen on a live switch while cssVars followed (pure
  CSS cascade). The singleton is now anchored on `globalThis` on the client
  (server stays module-level to avoid leaking state across concurrent SSR
  requests). (#275)
- **`OrigamRadio`, `OrigamTabs` and `OrigamSliderField` now call
  `useDefaults()`.** They declared theme-configurable props (`activeBgColor`,
  `variant`, `color`/`bgColor`) but never resolved
  `theme.components['origam-<name>']`, so that theme config was silently inert.
  (#279)
- **`OrigamDialog` `scrim` now renders.** `scrim` was missing from the
  component's `withDefaults(...)`, so Vue 3 coerced the unpassed boolean to
  `false` and forwarded it to `OrigamOverlay`, overriding the overlay's own
  `scrim: true` default — the backdrop never showed. Anchored `scrim: true` in
  `withDefaults` (same pattern as the existing `openOnClick` default). (#279)
- **`useDefaults` wiring no longer collapses `<origam-code>`'s header zone.**
  The origam base theme carried a `compact: true` default (authored in a bulk
  pass before `useDefaults` was wired, never visually validated); once the
  wiring landed it forced every code block without an explicit `compact` prop
  into the condensed single-line pill layout, dropping the
  header/filename/line-numbers/lang-badge. Removed from the base theme. (#249)
- **`OrigamBtnGroup` renders as a single rounded surface.** The group applies
  its `rounded`/`elevation` on the outer wrapper with `overflow: hidden`
  clipping children to the inner curvature — no forced child heights, no
  inner-radius tokens; group height derives from `OrigamBtn`'s own border-box
  height calc. (#239)
- **`OrigamSwitchTrack.error` widened from `boolean` to `string | boolean`**
  to match the canonical Commons `IValidationProps`, so the parent's
  validation surface is type-assignable again (was `vue-tsc` TS2345, CI red).
  Consumed by truthiness only — behaviour unchanged. (#239)
- **`OrigamLayout` / `OrigamApp` `full-height` no longer clamps content
  taller than one screen.** The full-height wrapper was `height: 100vh`
  (a hard clamp) instead of `min-height: 100vh` ("occupy at least the
  viewport"). Content overflowing past one screen still rendered (nothing
  was clipped — no `overflow: hidden` on that element), but the wrapper's
  own box never grew to match, so any ancestor sizing itself off that box
  (e.g. a themed page background) stopped short of the actual page height.
  `full-height` pages now grow naturally past one screen and the
  background/box always matches the true content height.
- Fixed a handful of pre-existing `$type: "dimension"` component tokens
  with non-numeric values (`auto`, `calc(...)`) that crashed the
  `size/rem` Style Dictionary transform and silently blocked
  `tokens:build` / the full package build (`btn.width`, `dialog.max-width`,
  `dialog.max-height`, `contextual-menu.max-height`, `menu.max-height`,
  `expansion-panel.header.append.margin-inline-start`,
  `expansion-panel.popout.max-width(-active)`,
  `expansion-panel.inset.max-width-active`) — retyped to `"other"`,
  matching the established pattern already used for equivalent tokens
  elsewhere in the same files. No visual/behavioural change; this only
  unblocks the build pipeline.

> The 8 marketing brand themes (glass · cartoon · geek · apple · editorial ·
> material · ecom) that these hooks enable live in the private
> `@origam/marketing` package and are **not** part of the npm `origam`
> release — this changelog tracks the published library only.

---

## [2.8.1] — 2026-07-15

### Fixed

- **The npm tarball now ships `README.md` and `LICENSE`.** The publish runs
  from `packages/ds/` exclusively, but the package dir contained neither
  file — both listed in the `files` array yet silently absent from every
  published version (the npm page showed no readme at all). The new
  npm-facing README covers install, quick start (plugin + token sheets +
  Nuxt module), the theming model and the granular exports, and links to
  the upcoming documentation site (https://origam.dev).

---

## [2.8.0] — 2026-07-15

### Added

- **Border per-side props are now wired** (`useBorder`). The discrete
  `borderTop` / `borderRight` / `borderBottom` / `borderLeft` props on
  `IBorderProps` — declared but never read until now — each accept a
  number (px), a boolean (legacy thin opt-in) or a free-form
  `"width style color"` string (same grammar as the global `border`
  shorthand). New per-side color overrides ship alongside:
  `borderTopColor` / `borderRightColor` / `borderBottomColor` /
  `borderLeftColor` (`TColor` — semantic intent or raw CSS color).
  Precedence is specific-over-global (global `border`, then standalone
  `borderColor` / `borderStyle`, then per-side width/style, then per-side
  color) and documented on `useBorder`. Emitted declarations are physical
  (`border-top-width`, …). `useStateEffect` forwards the 8 new props, so
  Card, Sheet and every other consumer gets them for free. Pilot
  component: Card (story + doc + e2e).
- **`useElevation` accepts a free-form custom `box-shadow` value.**
  `elevation` (new `TElevation` type) still takes a named origam rung or
  a Material 0–24 number, and now also any shadow-like CSS string
  (`var()` / `calc()` / `rgba()` / hex / length / `inset` signals),
  emitted verbatim as `box-shadow`. Previously a custom string silently
  produced NO shadow (`parseInt` read a leading `0` and resolved to the
  `none` rung). Pilot component: Card (story + doc + e2e).

### Changed

- **`OrigamBlockquote`: `bgColor` renamed to `accentColor` (non-breaking).**
  `bgColor` never painted a surface fill on Blockquote — it drove the
  decorative accent (bar, background quote glyph, author label), which the
  `bgColor` name misrepresented. `accentColor` is now the canonical prop;
  `bgColor` keeps working as a deprecated alias (`accentColor` wins when
  both are set) and logs a console warning once per session. Scope: this
  pass only touches Blockquote — `bgColor` stays canonical and
  non-deprecated on surface-fill components (Btn, Card, Chip, Badge,
  Alert, Pagination, …). Removal of the `bgColor` alias on Blockquote is
  targeted for v3.0.0. See `ROADMAP.md` — "Renommer `bgColor` →
  `accentColor`".

### Fixed

- **`useMargin`: 2-value strings work again.** `margin="8px 16px"` silently
  produced no styles (the 2-value case was missing from
  `formatMarginStylesVar`; padding already had it). Both utils now document
  the intentional 4-value order convention: values are grouped by logical
  axis — `block-start`, `inline-start`, `block-end`, `inline-end`
  (top / left / bottom / right) — NOT the native CSS clockwise shorthand.
  RTL-safe by design, arbitrated in #216.

### Internal

- Marketing `/theming` — the Theme Builder ships six rich, validated
  controls built from origam components (color/accentColor with intents +
  custom picker, density, rounded with per-corner link/unlink, elevation
  presets + full custom box-shadow, border with per-side width AND color
  link/unlink, padding/margin devtools-style box-model with axis linking).
- Marketing playground isolation: the `origam` preview theme now carries a
  complete GENERATED reset of every component var (~2700/mode, derived from
  the DS baseline sheets) — ambient brand themes can no longer leak into
  the playground preview.
- Marketing package restructured to the project architecture (`src/`
  srcDir, locales under `src/assets/locales`, wireframes under
  `wireframes/`).

---

## [2.7.3] — 2026-07-10

### Fixed

- **`OrigamField`: the `rounded` prop now drives the whole field chrome.**
  The prop used to round the outer box only (inline `border-radius`), while
  the inner chrome (outline legs, per-corner radii) reads
  `--origam-field---border-radius` — which the prop never touched, so the
  outline corners stayed at the default and mismatched the box (themes had
  to force the var with `!important` hacks). The field now mirrors the
  radius resolved from the `rounded` prop into its component var, keeping
  box and outline in sync for every field type (text, select, textarea,
  number, password, date, file, color). `shaped` / `shaped-invert` are
  unaffected and stay SCSS-owned.

---

## [2.7.2] — 2026-07-09

### Fixed

- **Default text (and every `currentColor` icon) rendered browser-black in
  dark mode.** The semantic text token flips correctly
  (`neutral-900 → neutral-50`) and `app.json` has declared
  `app.color` / `app.background-color` all along — but nothing consumed
  them. `OrigamApp` now paints the base pair
  (`color: var(--origam-app---color)`,
  `background-color: var(--origam-app---background-color)`), and
  `OrigamThemeProvider` (`display: contents`) sets the inherited `color`
  so a local `data-mode="dark"` sub-tree gets readable defaults too.
  Verified in both modes (computed styles) with no light-mode change.

---

## [2.7.1] — 2026-07-09

### Fixed

- **`origam/styles` CSS entry shipped empty.** `src/assets/css/main.css` was
  0 bytes in every published version (2.6.x, 2.7.0), so
  `import 'origam/styles'` (the `style`/`import`/`require` conditions)
  delivered no tokens and no utility classes — only the SCSS path
  (`@use 'origam/styles'`) worked. `main.css` is now compiled from
  `main.scss` at build time (`styles:build`): the full aggregate
  (primitives + light + dark + utilities + reset, ~366 KB) ships in the
  package.

### Internal

- New brand identity: the "cube sonobe" logo (modular origami — identical
  folded units assembling into a structure) replaces the legacy mark across
  the repo (docs/stories/marketing assets; not part of the npm tarball).
- npm publishing is handled by CI again (release workflow auth fixed).

---

## [2.7.0] — 2026-07-08

### Added

- `OrigamThemeProvider` now applies the active theme's **component default
  props** to its sub-tree (props-first theming cascades into sub-trees via
  `provideDefaults`), not just the `data-theme` / `data-mode` attributes. A
  `<origam-theme-provider theme="brand-x">` wrapper therefore gives every
  descendant that brand's per-component defaults.
- Glass theme: `OrigamAlert` glassmorphism (transparency + blur).

### Changed

- **`shiki` is now an OPTIONAL peer dependency** (removed from `dependencies`).
  `OrigamCode` degrades gracefully to plain, un-highlighted code when `shiki`
  is not installed (a one-time console warning is emitted; line numbers,
  highlight-lines and copy keep working). **Migration:** add `shiki` (`^4.3.1`)
  to your app's dependencies to keep syntax highlighting. This drops a heavy
  (~3 MB) hard dependency from apps that don't render code blocks.

### Fixed

- `OrigamPagination` colored mode (`color` / `bgColor`) now fills the page
  buttons. The theme's default `text` btn variant
  (`background-color: transparent !important`) was swallowing the intent fill,
  leaving resting buttons transparent; the row now forces the `flat` variant
  when a colour is set.
- Cartoon dark `/theming`: fields adopt the theme and the primary btn contrast
  is corrected.

### Internal

- Restored the green `vue-tsc` type-check gate under TypeScript 6.
- E2E suite stabilised: sharded CI plus deterministic fixture-drift fixes
  (variant-index / navigation realignment) — the "flaky" bucket was
  deterministic drift, not timing.

---

## [2.6.3] — 2026-07-03

### Changed

- Internal code-quality cleanup to green the SonarQube quality gate
  (`new_violations`): removed redundant type assertions, merged duplicate
  imports, extracted nested template literals, `||` → `??`, dropped a redundant
  `| undefined`, converted a call-signature interface to a function type, and
  removed a leftover CSS comment. **No API or runtime behaviour change** — pure
  refactor (PR #87).
- Marketing site (private, not part of the published `origam` package):
  `@nuxtjs/i18n` 9 → 10 and `@nuxtjs/seo` 2 → 5 (locales moved to `i18n/locales/`;
  v10 config breaking changes handled) — PR #88.

---

## [2.6.2] — 2026-07-03

### Changed

- Dependency maintenance (Dependabot): TypeScript 5.8 → 6.0, ESLint 9 → 10
  (+ `typescript-eslint`, `eslint-plugin-vue`), Style Dictionary 4 → 5
  (+ `@tokens-studio/sd-transforms` 1 → 2), Shiki 3 → 4 (VitePress docs), and a
  dev-tooling batch (`jsdom` 25 → 29, `happy-dom`, `sass`, `@types/node`,
  `unplugin-vue-components`, `lint-staged`, `globals`…). **Vite and Vue stay
  pinned** (`vite ~7.3.6`, `vue 3.5.35`) — their bumps were declined (Vite ≥ 7.3.5
  broke the build; the Vue override neutralises the bump). `react-dom` bump
  closed (not a dependency of a Vue design system).

### Fixed

- CI publish (`release.yml`): the npm publish step failed with **E404** because
  `pnpm publish` did not expand the `${NODE_AUTH_TOKEN}` placeholder from
  setup-node's `.npmrc` → the PUT went out unauthenticated. The resolved token is
  now written to the `.npmrc` pnpm reads before publish (PR #82). 2.5.0/2.5.1/2.6.0
  had failed here; 2.6.1 was published manually as a stop-gap.
- Test robustness: `transition.composable.spec.ts` used an invalid CSS sentinel
  (`transformOrigin: 'original'`) that jsdom 29 now rejects; switched to a valid
  value `top left` (PR #84).

---

## [2.6.1] — 2026-07-02

### Added

- `OrigamCode` — `compact` and `prompt` display modes (commit `5ebc6702`).
  Compact mode collapses the component to a single line (no gutter, no
  filename bar); `prompt` mode renders a shell-style `$` prefix. Two-axis
  theming support: the component now tracks both `data-theme` and
  `data-mode` on the host `<html>` element so it correctly switches in
  dark/light sub-trees (`fix(ds): OrigamCode two-axis theming` — commit
  `e2e716f2`). Scroller fill repaired in the same pass.
- `backdrop-filter` glassmorphism tokens on `Card` / `Sheet` / `Toolbar` /
  `Menu` — new token group `component.{card,sheet,toolbar,menu}.backdrop-filter`
  emitted as `--origam-{cmp}---backdrop-filter` CSS vars. Allows consumers
  to build frosted-glass surfaces without overrides (commit `71647594`).

### Changed

- Brand themes removed from the DS (ADR-004) — the `origam` package now
  ships only the `light` and `dark` base token sets. Consumer themes
  (`sobre`, `geek`, `glass`, `cartoon`, `apple`, `ecom`, `editorial`,
  `material`) are now authored in semantic JSON and installed via
  `createOrigam({ themes: [...] })` rather than bundled into the lib.
  The DS stays unopinionated; themes travel with the consumer
  (commits `fbea1e3f`, `5f1bf51c`, `e0a47050`, `edc30e80`, `f7c56f06`,
  `3b9f8510`).

### Fixed

- `OrigamImg` — `markBooted` `requestAnimationFrame` callback was called
  during SSR, crashing server-render (`fix(ds): guard OrigamImg markBooted
  rAF behind IN_BROWSER` — commit `6b09c5df`).
- Six SSR/theming gaps surfaced by the marketing site refactor: theme cookie
  injection race, `data-mode` missing on first SSR render, component-level
  token var scope, active-theme guard in `useTheme`, Menu/Tooltip token
  resolution under sub-tree providers, Nuxt hydration mismatch on theme
  toggle (commit `b9fe3219`).
- `OrigamSelect` — the chevron icon opened then instantly re-closed the menu
  on the very first click (field not yet focused): the opening `mousedown`
  bubbled to the control handler and double-toggled. The toggle now only
  runs when the field is already focused; otherwise the event bubbles to the
  single control handler that opens + focuses in one pass (PR #70).
- Sass `mixed-decls` deprecation warnings eliminated in `OrigamBtn` and
  `OrigamSwitchTrack` — declarations that followed a nested rule (`@media` /
  `&:focus-visible`) are moved above it. Pure reorder, identical compiled CSS
  (PR #73).
- Layout offset counted twice in SSR / production builds (invisible in dev):
  Vue's hydration-mismatch recovery could abandon a layout item mid-`setup()`
  after it registered, leaving an orphan in `registered` so a 240 px drawer
  reserved 480 px. `useLayoutItem`'s `register()` now evicts stale entries
  occupying the same `(order, position)` slot (PR #76).

---

## [2.6.0] — 2026-06-11

> **The bracket + a11y + theming release.** `OrigamBracket` ships as a
> production-ready e-sport tournament component (double-elimination, Grand
> Final, statuses, full cross-cutting prop surface). `v-contrast` becomes
> the DS-wide WCAG text-legibility guard applied to every colour-bearing
> component. A two-axis theming engine (`data-theme` × `data-mode`) replaces
> the previous single-axis approach and enables brand themes to be installed
> at runtime via `createOrigam()`. Multiple composables and layout components
> also land fixes. 170 commits total in this range (DS-relevant subset
> documented below).

### Added

- `v-contrast` directive — runtime WCAG 2.1 AA text-legibility guard
  (`feat(ds): v-contrast directive` — commit `8a80787a`). Applied
  automatically to every colour-bearing component in the same cycle
  (`feat(ds/a11y): apply v-contrast to all colour-bearing components` —
  commit `4a4d4473`). Two correctness fixes landed before release: correct
  WCAG luminance maths for composite translucent backgrounds (commit
  `96ff45c4`), and `color(srgb …)` token format support + guard against
  clobbering an explicit `color` prop (commits `34786ed5`, `12a3e378`).
- `OrigamBracket` — **major enrichment** on top of the 2.3.0 initial
  component. Full double-elimination layout with two independent trees +
  a Grand Final match (`feat(ds/bracket): real two-tree double-elimination
  layout` — commit `dee1c23d`; Grand Final — commit `560eaf5b`).
  Full cross-cutting prop surface on both `OrigamBracketMatch`
  (`rounded` / `elevation` / `border` / `color` / `bgColor` — commit
  `8998f0e3`) and `OrigamBracketCompetitor` (commit `3088ad31`).
  Distinct status indicators (live, forfeit) + live-link prop (commit
  `4d38c65c`). Connector trait inherits match `border-width` / `style` /
  `color` (commit `94242ab3`). State variant (hover / active) wired
  (commits `0f4d5924`, `5edeca52`, `92edcd1b`). Auto-contrast on match
  text and seed numbers via `v-contrast` (commit `4cd5bc44`).
  `OrigamDivider` used internally for the match divider (commit `c472bb71`).
- `OrigamBlockquote` — **major enrichment** from the initial Wave 4 stub.
  Two-axis colour model: `color` (foreground / accent) and `bgColor`
  (surface / left-bar background) applied on all 5 variants
  (`feat(ds/blockquote): two-axis colour model` — commit `ccfe8c82`).
  `bgColor` accent on every variant including `elegant` and `minimal`
  (commit `b2f5c1f3`). `color` also drives the source label (commit
  `d80e88ca`). Accent pseudo-element decoupled from the `border` prop
  (commit `c5843ee1`, revert + re-land in same release).
- `OrigamBottomNav` — three additions: dimension props (`width`, `height`,
  etc.) now apply (fix — commit `21d44f63`); `position` prop
  (`start | center | end`) controls item distribution (commit `395a797e`);
  `active` state exposed and diffused to the child buttons (commit
  `5bdb3e85`).
- `OrigamAvatarGroup` — three additions: `rounded`, `elevation`, `border`
  propagated to all child avatars (commit `725303bd`); `hover` / `active`
  state fan-out made reactive (commit `e163cfba`); click-outside collapses
  an expanded group (commit `c364aae3`).
- `OrigamAppbar` — `scroll-behavior="active"` engages the active surface
  state on scroll (commit `07feb981`). `hide` and `inverted` scroll
  behaviours repaired; `scrollBehavior` now accepts combined tokens
  (commits `01912f4c`, `b625ea1e`). Removed dead props: `absolute`
  (commit `50c5ea32`), `floating` (commit `3d707ef5`), `width` /
  `minWidth` / `maxWidth` (commit `c5e7a6b9` — layout owns the
  cross-axis).
- Two-axis theming engine — `data-theme` (brand identity) × `data-mode`
  (light/dark) replace the previous single `data-theme` approach. Shadow
  tokens gain per-theme variants (commit `f7c56f06`). `createOrigam()`
  gains a `theme` option to install one or multiple presets at init time,
  SSR no-flash (commits `edc30e80`, `5f1bf51c`, `3b9f8510`). Token
  authoring via semantic JSON (colors, radius, typography, shadow, spacing,
  animation groups) — `feat(ds): semantic JSON theme authoring` (commit
  `e0a47050`).
- Field validation surface extended to 5 additional field components
  (`InlineEdit`, `OtpInputField`, `Clipboard`, `NumberField`,
  `SliderField`) via unified `useValidation` wiring (commit `27977831`).
- `OrigamStatus` — forces its intent onto `color` / `bgColor` (non-
  overridable) so status badges are always correctly painted regardless of
  surrounding theme (commit `8a72740a`).

### Changed

- `OrigamAudio` — dimension props (`width`, `height`) now apply (commit
  `adaf4395`); content fills the available height with controls pushed
  to the bottom (commit `97207e26`); progress row grows when the bar is
  taller (commit `8f8f1c1f`); `rounded="none"` and shaped variants added
  (commit `073d0513`). Compact disc rendering fixed — oversized with
  floating grooves (commit `bef36e20`). Reactive `autoplay` (commit
  `0dc90fea`). Play-button focus tint lingering + playlist active item
  blinking fixed (commit `6e6042bb`).
- `OrigamToolbar` — `hover` / `active` now drive the surface colour
  (state-aware) (commit `c966e9c6`).
- `OrigamAlert` — removed redundant `prominent` prop (commit `f32af0a8`).
- `OrigamAvatar` — `color` prop now applies; `v-contrast` was previously
  overriding an explicit `color` (commit `369e0afa`). Dead `start` / `end`
  props removed (commit `84f324fe`).
- `OrigamApp` — now exposes only `color` / `bgColor` and forwards them to
  the layout (commit `111f6596`).
- DS-wide: `useStateEffect` repaired — runtime prop changes for
  `color` / `bgColor` and similar were silently ignored after initial
  mount (commit `a1a66120`). Reactive-update loops in `AvatarGroup` and
  `RadioGroup` killed (commit `4c5eb18d`).
- Monorepo migration — `packages/ds`, `packages/marketing`,
  `packages/stories`, `packages/docs`, `packages/tests`,
  `packages/figma-plugin` are now first-class pnpm workspace packages
  (commits `4d53558b`, `70f1819f`, `fa0ed997`).

### Fixed

- `OrigamBtn` — `border-color` and `border-style` are now customisable
  props (commit `b44add69`).
- `OrigamField` — themed `border-radius` now resolves via the real
  component token (commit `851b2a2f`).
- `OrigamExpansionPanels` — `useElevation` import missing, causing
  `ReferenceError` at mount (commit `2eef9288`).
- `OrigamDatePicker` — crash guard for empty `daysInMonth` when reading
  `date` prop (commit `896b9eec`).
- `OrigamBorder` — numeric `border-width` values were invisible (missing
  `border-style` and `border-color` defaults) (commit `e9a151ec`).
- `rounded="none"` — did not actually remove the border radius; affected
  `OrigamAudio` and other consumers (commit `073d0513`).
- `fix(ds): /* @vite-ignore */ on shiki dynamic import` — defensive guard
  to silence the Vite bundler warning on the `OrigamCode` lazy highlighter
  import (commit `f6bbc494`).
- DS/marketing integration — MDI class prefix resolution, search hotkey
  double-fire, Menu anchor positioning (commit `d113a245`); lib dist
  missing CSS in first production deploy (commit `62667fbc`).

## [2.5.1] — 2026-05-27

> **Patch.** Two housekeeping commits with no public API impact.

### Changed

- Repository structure cleaned up: unit specs moved to `tests/TU/`,
  the dev playground dropped (commit `52f7dc70`).
- `.gitignore` updated to exclude `tests/a11y/.report` and
  `tests/a11y/.results` artefacts (commit `6c2ef153`).

## [2.5.0] — 2026-05-24

> **The accessibility release.** WCAG 2.1 AA pass across the entire
> component catalogue, critical backlog items (Select combobox pattern,
> DataTable caption, ColorPicker keyboard), and a VitePress sidebar
> reorganised by UI taxonomy.

### Fixed

- WCAG 2.1 AA pass — 35 targeted fixes across 36 components covering:
  missing `aria-label` on icon-only buttons, incorrect `role` assignments,
  focus management gaps, colour-contrast warnings on default token values,
  and keyboard-navigation holes in Slider / Rating / Switch / Radio
  (commit `1ad0aeaf`).
- Critical a11y backlog:
  - `OrigamSelect` — full combobox ARIA pattern (`role="combobox"` +
    `aria-expanded` + `aria-activedescendant` + `aria-autocomplete`).
  - `OrigamDataTable` — `<caption>` element added so screen readers
    announce the table purpose.
  - `OrigamColorPicker` — keyboard navigation restored; tab order and
    focus ring corrected.
  - A11y test infrastructure wired (commit `b3dd8552`).
- VitePress docs — SSR crash in the build resolved; chart legend guard
  against undefined series data (commit `6cfb0029`).

### Changed

- VitePress component sidebar reorganised by UI taxonomy (layout /
  navigation / data-display / forms / feedback / utility) instead of
  flat alphabetical order (commit `0bd5e2f2`).

### Added

#### Chart engine

- `OrigamChart` + `useChart` — in-house chart component. 8 base types
  (`line` / `area` / `bar` / `column` / `pie` / `donut` / `scatter` /
  `radar`). Pure SVG rendering (no canvas, no `d3`, no `chart.js`, no
  `echarts`). Tooltip inline-positioned via mouse move; legend as
  `<ul role="list">` with click-to-toggle series visibility. Animated
  entrance with `prefers-reduced-motion` respect. Custom slots for
  `tooltip` / `legend-item` / `title` / `empty`. ARIA `role="img"` with
  `<title>` + `<desc>`; every data point is `tabindex="0"` +
  `role="button"` with a descriptive `aria-label`. Pure-function SVG
  path utilities — SSR-safe. `tokens/component/chart.json` (title,
  subtitle, axis, grid, tooltip, legend, point, bar, pie, radar,
  animation groups). (commit `b46541ce`)
- Family split into 9 per-type components (`OrigamChartCartesian`,
  `OrigamChartPolar`, `OrigamChartRadar`, `OrigamChartGauge`, …) sharing
  the engine via `OrigamChartAxis` and `OrigamChartLegend` sub-components
  (commits `4da143c9`, `c950c364`, `ef4ab360`).
- 15 additional chart families extending the base engine:
  - **Honeycomb / Treemap / Sankey / Word-cloud** (commit `94902edc`)
  - **Heatmap / Sunburst / Box-plot / Pictorial** (commit `c1e69d60`)
  - **Candlestick / Streamgraph** (commit `c5edc9b0`)
  - **Pyramid / Funnel** family with outside labels + leader lines on
    narrow bands (commits `445acb05`, `f4af7a27`, `293905bc`)
  - **Polar-bar / Variwide** (commit `26380205`)
  - **Pareto / Bullet** (commit `39f141a3`)
  - **Combination chart** (line + column / area + line) (commit
    `4406e92d` area, `10d012ad` bar-axis swap)
  - **Map / Choropleth / Flight-routes / Plot bands** (commit `c728bd94`,
    `6e72e7f4`)
  - **Stacked percent / Multi-axis Y** (commit `6e72e7f4`)
  - **Drilldown** (commit `8f827e7d`)
  - **Sparkline / Zoom-pan / RangeSelector** (commit `23d97e29`)
  - **Annotations** (arrows, label callouts, circle highlights, brackets)
    (commit `e1e41b89`)
- Chart composables wired to full DS cross-cutting prop surface
  (`IDimensionProps` via `useDimension`, `margin`, `padding`, `rounded`,
  `elevation`, `bgColor`) (commits `7179cd6c`, `e16742e0`).
- Scatter chart: `z` dimension drives bubble radius (commit `2eb6c868`).
- Pie / donut: multi-series concentric rings; per-slice legend toggle
  (commit `ba51275b`).
- DS intent colours and custom CSS colours resolve to the correct token
  namespace in charts (commit `8166cd1e`).
- 7 canonical transverse emit interfaces (`IChartEmits`, etc.) added
  (commit `e1c7b890`).
- DS-wide typed `defineEmits` migration — 7 batches covering 54+
  components (commits `01381e41`, `a03627a8`, `ce40e686`, `2ce1ccd2`,
  `3347bc58`, `279fb2f0`, `e91c9518`).

#### Media kit

- `OrigamAudio` + `useAudioPlayer` + `useWaveform` — in-house audio
  player. Custom UI (play/pause, scrubber, volume, waveform via
  `OfflineAudioContext`). Media Session API for lock-screen controls +
  metadata. Cover image. 3 controls modes. Vinyl disc animation. Stem-
  tracks (multi-channel mute/solo). Playlist with tri-state loop and
  random shuffle. Zero external dep. ARIA: dynamic `aria-label`,
  `role="slider"` on scrubber, `role="img"` on waveform. SSR-safe.
  `tokens/component/sound.json` (commits `293efc06`, `d3781288`,
  `9c12e283`, `f3d3c797`). Waveform + album ported from `OrigamSound`
  (commit `d5a0246b`). `useWaveform` moved to Audio namespace (commit
  `d4822f26`). `<OrigamSound>` namespace retired — superseded by
  `<OrigamAudio>` (commit `a77911bc`).
- `OrigamVideo` + `useVideoPlayer` — in-house video player. YouTube-style
  restructure: custom UI (play/pause, scrubber, volume, fullscreen, PIP,
  captions), 3 controls modes, WebVTT captions with language switcher,
  `aspect-ratio` preset, download prop + quality switcher in cog menu,
  YouTube-style skip ripple (half-disk + chevrons stagger). Zero external
  dep. ARIA: `role="slider"` on scrubber, `role="status"` / `role="alert"`
  on state overlays. SSR-safe. `tokens/component/video.json` (commits
  `8a37102e`, `97420a99`, `31dcfdae`, `f50ccbdb`, `dcccb4dd`, `0208b2f3`,
  `9bbbea96`, `75b0779f`, `80e2a9c0`).
- `OrigamMediaScrubber` — reusable horizontal + vertical media scrubber
  primitive (thin track, buffer indicator, hover thumb + tooltip). Used
  by both `OrigamAudio` and `OrigamVideo` for their respective scrubber
  and volume controls (commits `9f87c917`, `9e050390`, `15d53094`).
- `OrigamMediaController` — shared media-control shell extracted from
  `useVideoPlayer` (commit `2cbb9618`). `useMediaPlayer` base composable
  split out (commit `c2a9f282`).

#### New utility / content components

- `OrigamGrid` + `OrigamGridItem` — declarative CSS Grid wrapper. Props
  for `columns` / `rows` / `areas` / `gap` (token or raw CSS) /
  `autoFlow` / `align*` / `justify*` and item-level `column` / `row` /
  `area` / `*Self` shorthands. Object syntax (`{ start, end }`) or raw
  CSS strings (`'1 / 5'`, `'span 2'`) for span control. Token group
  `--origam-grid---gap-{xs,sm,md,lg,xl}` (commit `0ebb1cd4`).
- `OrigamMasonry` + `useMasonry` — Pinterest-style masonry layout.
  CSS-first via `grid-template-rows: masonry` (detected via `useCssSupport`
  — new `masonry` flag). JS bucket-fill fallback with `ResizeObserver`.
  Responsive columns via container-query breakpoints. `animated` prop.
  `tokens/component/masonry.json` (`animation-duration`,
  `animation-easing`) (commit `2691c4e5`).
- `OrigamEmptyState` — placeholder for absent data. 5 presets
  (`no-data` / `no-results` / `error` / `offline` / `locked`) with auto
  icon + intent mapping. Three sizes, two alignments. ARIA `role="status"`
  + `aria-live="polite"`. `tokens/component/empty-state.json` (commit
  `abaca302`).
- `OrigamClipboard` + `useClipboard` — copy-to-clipboard helper.
  `navigator.clipboard.writeText` + `execCommand` fallback. Scoped
  `#default` slot exposes `{ copy, copied, error }`. Auto-resetting
  feedback state. ARIA `aria-live="polite"`. SSR-safe.
  `tokens/component/clipboard.json` (commit `d93c2957`).
- `OrigamInlineEdit` + `useInlineEdit` — edit-in-place pattern. Click
  display → input prefilled → Enter confirms / Escape cancels. Async
  `validate` callback. Multiline textarea mode. Custom slots
  `#display` / `#edit` / `#actions`. ARIA `aria-invalid` +
  `aria-describedby`. `tokens/component/inline-edit.json` (commit
  `d4a95557`).
- `OrigamNumberFormat` + `useNumberFormat` — i18n number formatting via
  `Intl.NumberFormat`. 7 formats, full locale support with auto-resolution
  chain, LRU-cached `Intl` instances. Scoped `#default` slot exposes
  `{ formatted, parts, value }`. ARIA `aria-label` expansion for compact
  notation (commit `dd8bfe3c`).
- `OrigamWatermark` + `useWatermark` — diagonal repeating overlay. SVG
  data-URL (no canvas). Text or image mode. Anti-tamper MutationObserver.
  `pointer-events: none`. `tokens/component/watermark.json`. SSR-safe
  (commit `cc715c38`).
- `OrigamQRCode` + `useQRCode` — SVG QR code rendering via
  `qrcode-generator` (~5 kB). 4 ECC levels. Optional logo overlay.
  Rounded modules. LRU cache. ARIA `role="img"`. Renamed from
  `OrigamQRCode` → `OrigamQrCode` (Vue style guide — commits `9f5a4eea`,
  `eabb92a3`, `1ee2acf6`, `da34f20d`, multiple QrCode fixes).
- `OrigamCalendar` + `useCalendar` — full calendar. 4 views
  (month / week / day / agenda), navigation, events with
  start / end / color / category, range select with drag-to-create,
  RRULE recurring events (`DAILY | WEEKLY | MONTHLY` + `INTERVAL` /
  `COUNT` / `UNTIL` / `BYDAY`). Toolbar with view switcher. Locale-aware
  via `Intl.DateTimeFormat`. Zero external dep. ARIA
  `application / gridcell / toolbar` + keyboard navigation. SSR-safe
  (commit `8b5d7f0a`).
- `OrigamTextMask` + gradient color props — text reveals an animated
  background via `background-clip: text`. 4 animation types
  (`pan` / `rotate` / `pulse` / `zoom`) with `prefers-reduced-motion`.
  Zero JS (pure CSS keyframes). SSR-safe (commit `31f67d37`).
- Gradient support for `color` / `bgColor` / `textColor` props. Three
  input formats: raw CSS gradient string, `IGradient` structured object
  (`{ from, to, via?, direction?, type? }` or `{ stops: [...] }`), or
  preset name (`color="gradient-sunset"`). 5 built-in semantic presets
  (`sunset`, `ocean`, `forest`, `fire`, `midnight`) with light + dark
  variants. 100 % backward-compatible (commit `c922fbff`).
- `SliderField` — native HTML `<input type="range">` implementation
  (commit `d3781288`).

### Changed

- DS-wide reuse-interfaces audit — 9 batches (commits `d0afd731`,
  `2c6e3aab`, `325c4df1`, `5f1abaf8`, and earlier in the cycle).
  Every component that declared `height` / `width` / `margin` / etc.
  inline now `extends IDimensionProps` / `IMarginProps` / etc. and
  consumes the matching composable. Eliminates half-implemented
  surfaces and drift from the standard `convertToUnit` helper.
- All ~28 inline composable constants extracted to `src/consts/`
  (commits `7cd6ff81`, `de48f7da`).
- Story Playground variants universally renamed to `Default` across all
  177 stories (commits `cfeaa682`, `ace53342`, `f2e89284`).

### Fixed

- `OrigamChart` — area fill previously overridden by the SCSS
  `fill: none` cascade (commit `ed1c4610`); scatter points overflowing
  the plot zone (commit `ba51275b`); horizontal bar — category/value
  axis swapped (commit `f8ec65db`); legend click filtered wrong series
  index (commit `d25eae00`); `legendPosition` not moving the legend
  (commit `082d053b`); column/bar slots overlapping value axis on first
  index (commit `4406e92d`); stepped-line tail cut off (commit
  `ee45357a`); pie/donut legend showing wrong labels (commit `4406e92d`).
- `OrigamVideo` — double-click skip on desktop (`f50ccbdb`); controls bar
  clicks restored after overlay removal (`4fd5f375`); skip ripple sizing
  cascade (`80e2a9c0`, `9bbbea96`, `75b0779f`); cross-origin download
  via blob (`73c2e2a4`, `d84fa9bc`).
- `OrigamCalendar` — Calendar loading shape + active toolbar button
  contrast (`55e58b3d`).
- `OrigamQrCode` — intent-to-paint mapping, SVG host sizing, title
  centring (commits `c1823057`, `dceb4cfe`).
- Link composable — `ComputedRef` for `tag` and `href` unwrapped in
  templates; previously caused a `[object Object]` render (commit
  `9822c47b`, reverted and re-landed as `3f79d0c0`).
- `withDefaults()` inline literal rule enforced — `Grid`, `Masonry`,
  `Blockquote` were referencing `XXX_DEFAULTS` objects statically
  unresolvable by the SFC compiler, causing `undefined` prop crashes
  (commit `276fff1e`).
- `OrigamSnackbar` — `roundedClasses` `ReferenceError` at mount (commit
  `aa86f93c`).

## [2.3.0] — 2026-05-15

> **The features release.** Four new components, four major
> enrichments, an official Nuxt module, and a comprehensive SSR
> safety audit. All additions are backward-compatible — drop-in
> upgrade from 2.2.x. 378 unit tests (+158 vs 2.2.1), 0 lint errors.

### Added

- `origam/nuxt` sub-export — official Nuxt 3 / Nuxt 4 module. Auto-imports
  components and composables. SSR-safe theme resolution via cookie +
  `Sec-CH-Prefers-Color-Scheme` header (no FOUC, no hydration mismatch).
  Auto-injects token CSS files (primitive + selected themes + utilities).
  Configurable via `origam: {}` in `nuxt.config.ts`. Resolves through
  `modules: ['origam/nuxt']`. New `IOrigamNuxtModuleOptions` and
  `IOrigamNuxtRuntimeConfig` interfaces; new theme constants
  (`ORIGAM_THEME_AUTO`, `ORIGAM_THEME_LIGHT`, `ORIGAM_THEME_DARK`,
  `ORIGAM_THEME_ATTR`, `ORIGAM_THEME_STORAGE_KEY`). Reference
  documentation at `docs/integrations/nuxt.md`.

### Changed

- `OrigamTextField` — new `mask` prop with built-in patterns
  (`phone:fr`, `phone:us`, `phone:international`, `iban`, `siret`,
  `creditcard`, `date:iso`, `date:fr`, `date:us`, `time`, `time:12h`,
  `postcode:fr`, `postcode:us`) plus a custom pattern syntax
  (`#` = digit, `A` = letter, `*` = any, anything else is a literal).
  In-house mask engine — zero external dependency (no `imask.js` /
  `cleave.js` / `vue-the-mask`). Reactive validation pipeline with
  built-in `luhn` (credit card), `iban` (mod-97) and date parsers
  (`date:iso` / `date:fr` / `date:us`); custom validators accepted as
  `(unmasked) => boolean`. New emits `@valid(boolean)` and
  `@complete({ complete, unmasked })` fire on every value change. The
  v-model exposes the **unmasked** value while the DOM input displays
  the formatted (masked) one — paste handling strips literals and
  reformats, `aria-invalid` toggles on touched fields, and the engine
  auto-promotes phone-shaped patterns to `type="tel"` for mobile
  keyboard hints. New `useMask` composable, `applyMask` / `unmaskValue`
  / `resolveMaskConfig` / `validatePattern` utils, new `IMaskOptions`
  interface and `TMask` / `TBuiltInPattern` / `TPatternValidator`
  types.
- `OrigamTextareaField` — new `mode="rich"` enabling a lightweight
  HTML / Markdown editor based on `contenteditable`. Built in-house
  with zero external dependencies (no TipTap, ProseMirror, Quill).
  9 toolbar commands (`bold`, `italic`, `underline`, `link`,
  `list-bullet`, `list-ordered`, `heading`, `code-inline`,
  `clear-format`), customisable via the new `toolbar` prop (or
  `toolbar: false` to hide). Keyboard shortcuts (Cmd/Ctrl+B/I/U/K/E
  and Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+7/8 for the two list modes). New `output` prop
  switches the v-model serialisation between `'html'` (sanitised) and
  `'markdown'` (CommonMark-flavoured subset). New `toolbarPosition`
  prop (`'top' | 'bottom' | 'floating'`). New `format` emit fired on
  every toolbar click or keyboard shortcut with the command id (and
  the URL for link insertion). New slots `#toolbar` and
  `#toolbar-item` allow replacing the default UI entirely. Internal
  sub-component `OrigamRichToolbar.vue` + composable
  `useTextareaRich` own the contenteditable contract. In-house HTML
  sanitiser with allowlist on tags (`p`, `br`, `strong`, `b`, `em`,
  `i`, `u`, `a`, `ul`, `ol`, `li`, `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `code`),
  attributes (`href` restricted to `http:` / `https:` / `mailto:` /
  `tel:` plus relative URLs; `class` restricted to the
  `origam-rich--*` prefix), and stripping every `on*` event handler
  before per-tag filtering. External links are auto-hardened with
  `rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"`. ARIA:
  `role="toolbar" + aria-label` on the toolbar, real `<button>` per
  command with `aria-label` + `aria-pressed`, the editing surface
  carries `role="textbox" + aria-multiline="true"`. New tokens under
  `component/textarea-field/rich-*` (toolbar surface, button states,
  content padding, inline-code colors, link color, heading sizes).
  The plain-mode (`mode="plain"`, default) API is fully
  backward-compatible — passing nothing keeps the previous
  `<textarea>` behaviour.

- `OrigamCode` — major enrichment via shiki integration. Syntax
  highlighting for 13 languages (vue, ts, js, tsx, jsx, scss, css, json,
  bash, html, xml, yaml, md) plus `plaintext`. New props: `lineNumbers`,
  `highlightLines` (accepts both `number[]` and the range syntax
  `'2,5-7'`), `copyable`, `maxHeight`, `theme` (`'auto' | 'light' | 'dark'`),
  `wrap`, `filename`. Copy button with `navigator.clipboard` and an
  `execCommand('copy')` fallback for legacy WebViews. Lazy-init shiki
  highlighter cached as a module-level singleton across instances; an
  LRU (max 64 entries) caches highlighted HTML by `(code, lang, theme)`
  so re-renders never re-tokenise. Theme defaults to `auto` and tracks
  the host `<html data-theme>` attribute. New `useCode` composable
  exposing `{ highlight, prime, isReady, resetCacheForTesting }`. New
  utility `parseHighlightLines()` shared with stories/tests. Pure-CSS
  line-numbers gutter (CSS counter, no JS layout) and line-highlight
  swap (class toggle on already-rendered rows, no re-tokenisation).
  ARIA: `role="region"` on the surface, `aria-live="polite"` on the
  copy feedback, hidden line numbers. `shiki` (`^3.8.1`) promoted from
  `devDependencies` to `dependencies` (it's a runtime dep now); the
  bundle adds ~3 MB to installed `node_modules` for the curated subset.
  New tokens under `component/code` (35 vars: surface, header, filename,
  copy button, line-number gutter, line-highlight, scrollbar). The v2.x
  plain-text `<pre>` API is fully backward-compatible — passing just
  `code` and `lang` keeps the previous behaviour.

- `OrigamParallax` — major enrichment. Multi-layer support via new
  `OrigamParallaxLayer` subcomponent (`speed`, `offsetX`, `offsetY`,
  `zIndex` props; layers register themselves into the host runtime and
  receive direct DOM mutations of `transform` outside Vue reactivity).
  Host gains `direction` (`'vertical' | 'horizontal' | 'both'`),
  `easing` (`'linear' | 'ease-out' | 'spring'`, in addition to the
  legacy raw CSS timing-function string), `disabled`, `speed`,
  `threshold` props. New emits: `@enter`, `@leave`,
  `@scroll-progress(0→1)` driven by `IntersectionObserver` +
  `requestAnimationFrame`. `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` is honoured
  natively — layers stay at `translate3d(offsetX, offsetY, 0)` and the
  rAF loop short-circuits. CSS-first scroll-driven animations
  (`animation-timeline: view()`) when `view-timeline` is supported
  (Chrome 115+, Edge 115+) AND `easing === 'linear'`; JS fallback
  otherwise. Spring easing implemented as a damped lerp in the JS path.
  Existing single-layer / `<OrigamParallaxElement>` API preserved (the
  two layer kinds use independent injection contexts and can coexist
  inside the same host). New tokens: `parallax.transition-duration-spring`,
  `parallax.transition-easing-default` / `-spring`,
  `parallax.layer.will-change` / `.transform-origin`.

### Added

- `OrigamCommandPalette` — ⌘K command launcher. Built on a teleported
  dialog with focus trap + focus restoration. Custom subsequence-based
  fuzzy-match algorithm (no external dep) ranks results by
  consecutive-run + label-prefix + first-position bonuses. Composable
  `useCommand` exposes a process-wide command registry — entries
  registered inside a Vue effect scope auto-unregister on dispose.
  Reuses `OrigamKbd` for inline shortcut display. Hotkey listener
  built on `useHotkey` (default `⌘+K` on macOS, `Ctrl+K` on
  Windows / Linux, configurable per combination or disabled with
  `:hotkey="null"`). ARIA combobox pattern (`role="combobox"` on the
  input, `role="listbox"` on the result list, `role="option"` per
  item, `aria-activedescendant` tracking the keyboard cursor) +
  `role="dialog"` + `aria-modal="true"` on the surface. Tokens exposed
  under `tokens/component/command-palette.json`
  (`--origam-command-palette---*`,
  `--origam-command-palette__input---*`,
  `--origam-command-palette__item---*`,
  `--origam-command-palette__group-title---*`,
  `--origam-command-palette__empty---*`,
  `--origam-command-palette__footer---*`,
  `--origam-command-palette--backdrop---*`).

- `OrigamBracket` — e-sport tournament tree. Supports single-elimination,
  double-elimination and round-robin variants. SVG connectors
  auto-computed from `nextMatchId` (with positional fallback). Slots for
  custom match / competitor / round-title / connector rendering. ARIA
  `role="region"` with per-round `role="group"` + `aria-labelledby`
  pointing at title headings. Tokens exposed under
  `tokens/component/bracket.json` (`--origam-bracket---*`,
  `--origam-bracket-match---*`, `--origam-bracket-competitor---*`,
  `--origam-bracket-connector---*`, `--origam-bracket-round-robin---*`).

- `OrigamSnackbarStack` — multi-toast notification system. Reuses
  `OrigamSnackbar` styling vocabulary for rendering. Composable
  `useSnackbarStack({ id })` exposes `notify` / `dismiss` /
  `dismissAll`. 8 anchor locations, max stack size with FIFO eviction,
  per-item auto-dismiss (or `0` for sticky), action buttons with
  optional `keepOpen`, ARIA `role="region"` on the stack root +
  `role="status"` / `"alert"` per intent on each item with matching
  `aria-live`. Slide-in / slide-out transitions degrade to a fade under
  `prefers-reduced-motion`. Tokens exposed under
  `tokens/component/snackbar-stack.json`
  (`--origam-snackbar-stack---*`, `--origam-snackbar-stack__item---*`).

- `OrigamTabs` / `OrigamTab` / `OrigamTabPanels` / `OrigamTabPanel` —
  full tab system with horizontal / vertical orientation, three visual
  variants (`default` / `pills` / `underline`), ARIA `role="tablist"` +
  `role="tab"` + `role="tabpanel"` wiring, full keyboard navigation
  (`←`/`→`/`↑`/`↓`/`Home`/`End`/`Enter`/`Space`), lazy or eager panel
  mounting, optional touch-swipeable panels. Reuses the shared
  `useGroup` orchestration so the selection state, mandatory behaviour
  and disabled-tab semantics align with the rest of the system
  (`OrigamBtnToggle`, `OrigamCarousel`, `OrigamBottomNav`). Tokens
  exposed under `tokens/component/tabs.json` (item color, indicator
  color, panel padding, transition duration).

- `OrigamClientOnly` — SSR helper component that renders its default
  slot only after `onMounted`. Optional `#fallback` slot (or
  `placeholder-tag` / `placeholder-class` props) reserves layout space
  during SSR to avoid CLS. Use to wrap fragments whose markup truly must
  differ between server and client (audio, deviceorientation,
  IntersectionObserver-driven features, …) without triggering hydration
  mismatches.

- `useCssSupportClient(feature, { defaultValue })` — hydration-safe
  feature-gate helper. Returns a `Ref<boolean>` that starts at
  `defaultValue` (default `false`) on both SSR and first client render,
  then flips to the real `CSS.supports()` result inside `onMounted`.
  Use to gate **markup** branches (template `v-if`) when the regular
  `useCssSupport().css.value.X` would produce a hydration mismatch
  (class-only branches keep using the existing API — Vue 3 reconciles
  class diffs fine).

### Fixed

- SSR safety — comprehensive audit of all composables and components
  that previously could crash on server render (`window is not defined`,
  `document is not defined`). `useCssSupport` already returned all-false
  flags during SSR; the rest of the surface (`useTheme`, `useCommand`,
  `useSnackbarStack`, `useCode`, `useMask`, `useTouch`, `useHotkey`,
  `useSticky`, `useSheetSwipe`, `useScroll`, `useParallax`, `useStyleTag`,
  `useTeleport`, `useLocationStrategies`, `useScrollStrategies`,
  `useDisplay`) was confirmed safe via the audit and patched where a
  composable's public method or a `computed` could be evaluated during
  SSR. Specifically: `useAspectRatio` no longer dereferences
  `window.innerWidth/Height` when no explicit `aspectRatio` prop is
  given; `useVirtual`'s `viewportHeight` computed guards
  `document.documentElement`; `useSnackbarStack.dismiss()` guards
  `window.clearTimeout`. Overlay components (Dialog, Drawer, Menu,
  Tooltip, Snackbar, ContextualMenu, SnackbarStack, CommandPalette)
  confirmed SSR-safe via `<Teleport>` (Vue defers the mount until the
  client). New guide `docs/guide/ssr.md`. New `src/__tests__/ssr-smoke.spec.ts`
  exercises every refactored composable in a simulated SSR environment
  (window/document/CSS stripped) **and** through `@vue/server-renderer`'s
  real `renderToString()`.

---

## [2.2.1] — 2026-05-14

### Fixed

- Expose `./package.json` explicitly in the `exports` map. The catch-all
  `"./*": "./dist/src/*"` previously intercepted `import 'origam/package.json'`
  and re-routed it to a non-existent file inside `dist/`. Standard
  consumer pattern (reading the version from the package metadata) was
  broken — fixed by adding `"./package.json": "./package.json"` ahead
  of the catch-all so it matches first.
- 2.2.0 was tagged but never published to npm. 2.2.1 is the first
  version that lands on the registry.

---

## [2.2.0] — 2026-05-14

> **The "ready for npm" release.** Package metadata, peer dependencies,
> tree-shaking signals and a real README are all in. Tarball preview
> shrunk from 5.6 MB to **867.9 kB** (2 343 files, zero suspect entry).
> No public API change vs 2.1.0 — every consumer upgrade is a
> drop-in.

### Added — stories, slots, emits coverage

- 525+ missing `Slot` / `Emit` Variants across 113 component stories
  (`feat(stories)`). Every documented slot now has a dedicated Variant
  with a custom-content example, and every emit a Variant that logs
  to a live counter.
- `OrigamSwitchTrack` extracted as a standalone primitive (track-only)
  so consumers can build switch-like compounds without rewriting the
  thumb logic.
- Tooling: `useStateEffect` now reacts to every per-axis composable
  (`useHover` / `useActive` / `useFocus`) in a single call — collapses
  the 14 components that historically wired them axis by axis.

### Fixed

- `useStyle` now instrumented across the 124 components that
  previously inlined `*Styles` arrays — single source of truth for the
  inline-style escape hatch.
- Carousel — `progress` prop renders a real-time progress bar wired to
  the cycle timer (was rendering a static "step / total" bar).
- Carousel — `hideDelimiterBackground` finally has a background to
  hide (default `__controls` bg = `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4)`).
- Histoire sandbox/panel sash now resizes the iframe in **both
  directions** (was capped at the 720 px responsive-preset width when
  dragging right).
- `useRounded` — utility variants (`xs|sm|md|lg|xl|none|full`) now
  emit BOTH the `.origam--rounded-*` class AND an inline
  `border-radius` declaration as a specificity escape hatch (Strategy
  A documented in `CLAUDE.md`).
- 130 unused-vars cleared from `src/`, 39 ESLint warnings fixed.

### Changed — package for npm

- `peerDependencies` introduced: `vue ^3.5`, `vue-i18n ^11`,
  `vue-router ^4.5` (last two `optional` via `peerDependenciesMeta`).
  They are no longer auto-installed as `dependencies` — consumers
  bring their own versions.
- `sideEffects: ["**/*.css", "**/*.scss", "**/*.vue"]` for downstream
  tree-shaking.
- `engines.node: ">=22"` (matches `.nvmrc`).
- `prepublishOnly` script chains `tokens:build` → `server:build` →
  unit tests. Every `npm publish` rebuilds from scratch with green
  tests.
- `files` whitelist tightened to `dist/src/`, `dist/tokens/`, LICENSE,
  README, CHANGELOG. The Histoire bundle (`dist/stories/`, ~13 MB) is
  no longer shipped to consumers.
- `build.config.ts` `externals` extended to `['vue', 'vue-i18n',
  'vue-router', '@mdi/font']` so peer deps don't get re-bundled.
- mkdist exclusion patterns expanded: `.spec.ts`, `__tests__/**`,
  `.cy.ts`, `.story.vue` are stripped from `dist/`.
- ESLint config ignores `docs/.vitepress/cache/**` and
  `figma-plugin/**` (these aren't part of the published library).

### Documentation

- Full `README.md` written from scratch (253 lines) — install,
  peer deps, plugin registration, theming (`data-theme` +
  `useTheme()` + `<OrigamThemeProvider>`), token tiers, component
  families, composable table, CSS-first principle.

### Internal

- ESLint rule `no-restricted-imports` blocks `@origam` /
  `@stories` / `@docs` / `@cypress` aliases inside `src/` — once
  published, those aliases can't be resolved by consumers.
- 124 components instrumented with `useStyle` following the
  canonical pattern.
- `.tsbuildinfo` and other transient artefacts removed from the tree.

## [2.1.0] — 2026-05-07

> **The classes-first release.** The 13 transversal composables
> (`useColor`, `useBackgroundColor`, `useTextColor`, `useColorEffect`,
> `useElevation`, `useRounded`, `useBorder`, `useMargin`, `usePadding`,
> `useSize`) now emit utility classes (e.g. `.origam--bg-primary`,
> `.origam--shadow-md`) when the consumer passes a tokenised value. The
> existing `*Styles` outputs stay populated only when the value is
> non-tokenisable (legacy hex, custom dimensions) — the inline style
> stack on a typical button drops from ~12 to ~6 declarations.
>
> **Non-breaking.** Every composable keeps its previous return shape;
> the new `*Classes` keys are additive. Components have been migrated
> to read both shapes in parallel (transition strategy A).

### Migrating from v2.0 to v2.1

Nothing is required. The release is additive; existing consumers keep
working unchanged. To start using the new path:

```vue
<!-- v2.0 — still works, still emits inline style -->
<OrigamBtn color="primary">Click</OrigamBtn>

<!-- v2.1 — same code, but the emitted DOM now also carries the
     `.origam--bg-primary` utility class instead of inline
     `background-color: var(...)`. Inspecting the DOM is much cleaner. -->
```

If you write your own components on top of `useColor*` / `useElevation`
/ `useRounded` / etc., you can now destructure the new `*Classes`
return:

```ts
const { colorClasses, colorStyles } = useColorEffect(props, isHover, isActive, isDisabled)
// colorClasses: ['origam--bg-primary']  when intent
// colorStyles : []                       when intent
// colorClasses: []                       when '#7c3aed'
// colorStyles : ['background-color: ...']when '#7c3aed'
```

Bind both — `:class="[..., colorClasses]"` AND `:style="[..., colorStyles]"`.
The hover/active/disabled state still flows through `colorStyles` (utility
classes are static, by design).

### Added

- **66 utility classes** generated by Style Dictionary, exposed at
  `origam/tokens/css/utilities` and forwarded by `origam/styles`:
  - `.origam--color-{primary|secondary|success|warning|danger|info|neutral}`
  - `.origam--bg-{primary|secondary|success|warning|danger|info|neutral}`
  - `.origam--shadow-{none|xs|sm|md|lg|xl}`
  - `.origam--rounded-{none|xs|sm|md|lg|xl|full}`
  - `.origam--border-{none|thin|thick}`
  - `.origam--p-{0..12}`, `.origam--m-{0..12}`, `.origam--gap-{0..12}`
  - `.origam--text-{xs|sm|md|lg|xl|2xl}`
- New return keys on transversal composables:
  `colorClasses`, `backgroundColorClasses`, `textColorClasses`,
  `elevationClasses` (extended), `roundedClasses` (extended),
  `borderClasses` (extended), `marginClasses`, `paddingClasses`,
  `sizeClasses`.
- `tests/e2e/utilities.spec.ts` — 66 Playwright tests, one per
  utility class, asserting both class presence and `getComputedStyle`
  resolution against the CSS var pipeline.
- `tests/e2e/prop-audit-phase4.spec.ts` — DOM audit on representative
  components confirming the inline-style pile reduction.
- 79 new Vitest unit specs in `src/composables/Commons/__tests__/`
  covering the classes-first branch of every refactored composable.

### Changed

- ~54 components migrated to consume `*Classes` in parallel with
  `*Styles`. Notable surface-bearing children: Menu/Tooltip/Picker/
  Snackbar/Badge — utility class lands on the `__content` / `__pill` /
  `__wrapper` BEM child, never on the teleport root.
- `OrigamSelectionControl.__wrapper` now carries
  `useTextColor(color)`'s class + style on its root element. This
  re-instates the Switch thumb tinting (`currentColor`) for tokenised
  intents, which had silently broken when `OrigamSwitchTrack` was
  extracted earlier in the cycle.
- `OrigamSwitch` SCSS — the legacy `[style*="color:"]` selector is
  joined by a class-driven set
  (`.origam-selection-control__wrapper.origam--color-{intent} &__thumb`)
  so both the new tokenised path and the legacy hex path tint the thumb
  via `currentColor`.

### Deprecated

- `*Styles` returns on the 10 refactored composables — prefer the
  matching `*Classes` for tokenised values. Both are kept for one
  major cycle; removal scheduled for v3.0.0.

### Fixed

- `OrigamSwitch` thumb stayed white when `color="primary"` (or any
  tokenised intent) — regression from the `OrigamSwitchTrack`
  extraction. Re-introduced via classes-first.
- `OrigamSnackbar` `__wrapper` no longer duplicates the
  `roundedClasses`/`borderClasses` already applied at the root.

### Known limits — planned for v2.2 (Phase 1.5)

- No utility for margin / padding axes (`mx`, `my`, `mt`, `mb`, `ml`,
  `mr`, `px`, `py`, `pt`, `pb`, `pl`, `pr`). Components passing
  axis-specific values fall back to inline styles for now.
- No `2xl` / `3xl` shadow utilities (the rungs exist as primitives but
  are off the manifest).
- Legacy `ROUNDED` enum (`x-small | small | default | medium | large
  | x-large | shaped | shaped-invert`) does not bridge to the
  `none|xs|sm|md|lg|xl|full` utility taxonomy — components passing a
  legacy value get their existing component-scoped BEM modifier and an
  inline style fallback.
- `useColorEffect` does NOT emit a `*Classes` value when `isHover` /
  `isActive` / `isDisabled` is true (states are inline-only by design).
  Components that bind `useActive(props, 'modelValue')` (Alert, Badge,
  BottomNav) therefore never carry a utility class while visible — the
  inline style still paints them correctly. This is intentional; do not
  rely on the utility class for state-dependent styling.

---

## [2.0.0] — 2026-04-26

> **The design tokens release.** Every component now resolves its colors,
> spacing, typography, and motion through a centralised, theme-aware
> token pipeline (Style Dictionary v4 + Tokens Studio for Figma). 50+
> components migrated; 18 of them also picked up real bug fixes from the
> companion `optimus-design-system` codebase. Multi-theme (light / dark)
> works out of the box; `brand-X` themes are an additive layer.

### Migrating from v0.x to v2.0.0

This is a major bump because three things change:

1. **The CSS variables that components read are now generated.** The old
   `<style>:root{}` blocks that each component shipped have been removed.
   Consumers MUST load the generated token CSS — either:

   ```ts
   import 'origam/styles' // primitive + light + dark + helpers
   ```
   or pick the layers separately:
   ```ts
   import 'origam/tokens/css/primitive'
   import 'origam/tokens/css/light'
   import 'origam/tokens/css/dark' // applied via [data-theme="dark"]
   ```

   If you were overriding origam vars at the document root (e.g.
   `:root { --origam-btn---background-color: red }`), that still works —
   the generated CSS is just a default. But if you depended on the
   per-component `:root{}` block being injected when the component
   mounted, that's gone. The vars are now set once globally.

2. **`useColorEffect` is intent-aware.** The `color` / `bgColor` props on
   `<OrigamBtn>`, `<OrigamChip>`, `<OrigamAvatar>`, etc. now expect a
   semantic intent (`'primary'`, `'success'`, `'danger'`, …) rather than
   a raw hex. Raw hex still works but emits a one-shot `console.warn`
   per `(prop, value)` pair (full removal in v3.0.0).

   ```vue
   <!-- v0.x -->
   <OrigamBtn color="#7c3aed">Click</OrigamBtn>

   <!-- v2.0 -->
   <OrigamBtn color="primary">Click</OrigamBtn>

   <!-- One-off custom color -->
   <OrigamBtn :style="{ '--origam-btn---background-color': '#7c3aed' }">…</OrigamBtn>
   ```

3. **`useElevation` no longer computes shadows in JS.** The `bgColor`
   parameter is accepted for signature compat but ignored. The composable
   now emits `box-shadow: var(--origam-shadow-{rung})` and the rung is
   themed at the token level (different shadow recipes for light vs dark).

   The legacy `formatElevationStyle(level, bgColor)` utility is still
   exported but `@deprecated` — it will be removed in v3.0.0.

### Added

- **Multi-tier design tokens** (`tokens/`):
  - Primitive: 12 color ramps, 12 spacing steps, full font / radius /
    shadow / motion / zIndex / opacity / border ladders.
  - Semantic: `surface`, `text`, `border`, `action.{primary,secondary,
    ghost}`, `feedback.{success,warning,danger,info}`, `overlay`. Per
    theme (light + dark), with hooks for brand-X.
  - Component: ~60 files, one per component, in DTCG / Tokens Studio
    format — editable from the Figma plugin.
- **Pipeline**: Style Dictionary v4 + sd-transforms. Outputs CSS,
  SCSS partials, and TypeScript union types. `npm run tokens:build`,
  `tokens:watch`, `tokens:lint`.
- **GitHub Action** (`.github/workflows/tokens-sync.yml`): consumes
  Figma → Tokens Studio → `tokens-sync` branch, rebuilds artifacts,
  opens a PR to `develop` automatically.
- **Multi-theme runtime**:
  - `useTheme()` composable — singleton ref, persistence, prefers-
    color-scheme fallback, toggle helper.
  - `<OrigamThemeProvider theme="dark">` for sub-tree overrides.
- **CSS-first / JS-fallback principle**:
  - `useCssSupport()` composable — feature detection layer wrapping
    `CSS.supports()` with caching for 20 modern features (subgrid,
    container queries, `:has()`, aspect-ratio, color-mix, anchor
    positioning, view transitions, …). Components now branch via
    this composable instead of calling `CSS.supports()` directly.
- **Defaults system** (ported from optimus):
  - `useDefaults()` composable + `<OrigamDefaultsProvider>` for
    cascading default props (mirrors Vuetify's `<v-defaults-provider>`).
  - `IDefault`, `IDefaultProviderProps`, `IDefaultProviderSlots`.
- **`<OrigamConfirmWrapper>`** — type-it-twice form helper with
  auto-injected validation, two render modes (slot-based / `field=`
  shortcut), and bidirectional defaults forwarding.
- **`SCSS helpers`** (`src/assets/scss/_helpers.scss`): `ds-intent`,
  `ds-elevation`, `ds-text-style`, `ds-space`, `ds-focus-ring`,
  `ds-visually-hidden`.
- **VARIANT / VARIANT_INPUT enums** + `TVariant` / `TVariantInput`
  types.
- Common emit / slot interfaces: `IFieldEmits`, `IFieldSlots`,
  `IFieldDefaultSlotProps`, `IInputEmits`, `IInputSlots`,
  `IAdjacentEmits`, `IAdjacentSlots`, `IAdjacentInnerEmits`,
  `IAdjacentInnerSlots`, `IActiveEmits`, `IFocusEmits`,
  `ICommonsComponentEmits`, `ICommonsComponentSlots`.

### Changed

- **Every component** with chrome (~50) now consumes design tokens
  rather than hardcoded values. The per-component `<style>:root{}`
  blocks are gone.
- **`OrigamPasswordField`** rebuilt from the optimus version (629
  vs 399 lines). New features: strength-requirements popup
  (`requirements` + `need*` flags + `minLength`), auto-injected
  validation rules, show/hide toggle, intersect-driven autofocus,
  click:control / mousedown:control emits.
- **`OrigamFileField`** split into 3 files (FileField + DragNDropItem
  + ListItem) for clearer responsibility boundaries; drag-and-drop
  mode reworked, `maxFileSize` validation added, typed emits.
- **`OrigamForm`** grew form-level validation, `scrollToError`,
  global `messages` rendering through OrigamMessages.
- **`OrigamField`** now exposes the `outline__notch` BEM child for
  the floating-label rendering, slot-based prefix/suffix detection,
  and proper focus↔active synchronisation.
- **Snackbar z-index** normalised from `10000` to `1060` via
  `{zIndex.toast}`. Consumers stacking custom overlays on top must
  verify their stacking context.
- **`color.action.primary.bgSubtle / fgSubtle`** added to the
  semantic layer (was missing — Select selected-item background and
  Slider thumb focus ring needed it).

### Fixed

- **OrigamMessages**: `:id` was bound to the entire messages array
  instead of the current message. Fixed by using a kebab-cased
  per-message key.
- **OrigamNumberField**: `watchEffect` → `watch(props.modelValue)` —
  the eager mode was causing reactive write loops while the user
  typed. Increment / decrement handlers split.
- **OrigamOtpInputField**: undefined-current crash guard;
  `isValidNumber` → `isInvalidValue` (semantic was inverted);
  double `update:focused` emit prevented; handleClear added.
- **OrigamFileField**: `@clik:append` and `@lick:append-inner` typo
  fixes; drag&drop append mode no longer overwrites existing files;
  locale arg shape `t(key, [arg])` corrected.
- **OrigamMenu**: stray `console.log()` removed.
- **OrigamOverlayScrim**: `<style scoped>` block was missing
  entirely — scrim wasn't rendering.
- **OrigamProgressCircular**: `backgroundColorClasses` /
  `loaderColorClasses` were missing on the SVG `<circle>` elements.
- **OrigamProgressLinear**: `useBackgroundColor` → `useTextColor`
  (the bar's color was being applied as background, washing it out).
- **OrigamListSubheader**: vuetify-specific
  `rgba(var(--v-theme-on-surface), …)` references replaced with
  origam-native tokens. Style block converted from `lang="css"` to
  `lang="scss"`.
- **OrigamExpansionPanel**: vuetify shadow var leak
  (`var(--v-shadow-key-umbra-opacity, …)`) removed; selector
  `:not(.v-expansion-panel-title--static)` matched a vuetify class
  that never renders in origam — corrected to the origam class.
- **OrigamSlideGroup**: `<style scoped>` block was missing entirely.
- **OrigamCheckbox / OrigamCheckboxBtn / OrigamSelectionControl**:
  `handleClickLabel` argument typed `MouseEvent` (was `Event` —
  caused TS strict failures).
- **OrigamSelectionControlGroup**: `item` slot now exposes
  `{ item, index }` (was `{ item }` only).

### Deprecated

- `formatElevationStyle(level, bgColor)` — replaced by the
  `--origam-shadow-{rung}` token ladder. Kept exported for one
  major version; full removal in v3.0.0.
- Raw hex / rgb passed to `useColorEffect` color props — pass a
  `TIntent` value or use `:style` for one-off custom colors. Removal
  in v3.0.0.

### Outstanding (deferred to v2.x or v3.0.0)

- Several form components still carry hardcoded hex inside their
  scoped styles (Switch 11, Select 8, DatePickerField 5,
  ColorPickerField 2, Img 2, Highlight 3). The token JSONs are in
  place; the `var(--origam-…)` references need to be wired in a
  follow-up. Fallback-only behaviour ensures consumers see the
  intended design today.
- Outstanding token-naming gaps: `color.surface.chrome` (SystemBar),
  `color.overlay.backdrop` (Drawer / Overlay scrim), `color.surface
  .inverse` (Tooltip), `opacity.20` / `opacity.30`, `radius.xs2: 6px`,
  `font.size.6xl: 45px`, `font.letterSpacing.widish`. Promote at
  next ui-designer review.
- `OrigamMain` uses `--origam-main--{prop}` (double-tiret) instead
  of the canonical `---` convention. Cosmetic, breaks consumer
  overrides. To be aligned at v3.

## Pre-2.0 history

The `[WIP]` commits before this release were the foundation work
(audit, Figma integration spike, package layout). The design-token
migration started at commit `2124ab8` (Lot 0) and shipped over
ten incremental commits visible in `git log --oneline main..HEAD`.
